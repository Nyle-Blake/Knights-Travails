# Knights-Travails

This program is purely vanilla JS. There are two files one for the knights travails algorithm using a graph, an adjacency list, and a queue, and another using just a queue. graphV and nonGraphV<br>
<br>
The programs calculate the shortest path that a knight could take from one square to another square on a chess board.<br>
<br>
In this case the board is 64 squares, 8x8 nested arrays that hold a co-ordinate (e.g. [2, 3]) so the max value would be 7 due to zero-based indexing.<br>
<br>
A knight can only move in Ls so the path is never linear and there is often multiple shortest paths.
